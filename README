Trinidad sandbox extension
======

# DESCRIPTION

Trinidad's management console and REST api.

This extension adds a management console to a Trinidad's instance moreover a rest api to access the applications running on top of it.


# INSTALL

jruby -S gem install trinidad_sandbox_extension

# CONFIGURATION

The extension has to be added within the section "extensions" into the Trinidad's configuration file:

---
  extensions:
    sandbox:

This extension is also a Sinatra web application running on top of Trinidad, so any application configuration parameter is also valid here.
For instance, we can modify the context path where is running the console:

---
  extensions:
    sandbox:
      context_path: management # by default the context path is sandbox

It also supports basic authentication, we'll have to specify the username and password within our section:

---
  extensions:
    sandbox:
      username: manager
      password: XXXXXXX

# FEATURES

The console as well as the REST api allow to list all the applications managed by that Trinidad's instance and start/stop them.
By security reasons the sandbox application is not listed nor can be stopped.


# TODO

This can be the starting point to a real management console, we could modify application parameters, show statistics...
Any improvement or redesign in the UI is welcome.
